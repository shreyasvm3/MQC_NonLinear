Data for figures 1, 2 & 3. All data corresponds to Model A. Code is also included. 

Data has not been renormalized -- as a consequence total energy in all the oscillators combined is not constant over time. Needs to be renormalized before plotting. 

Output files for MQC also contain TCFs for the un-modified operator B. Check code for output format.
